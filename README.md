# COMP-472-Project

## Objective: 

Implement different search algorithm ( Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Best First Search, and A* search) to solve the 8-puzzle game using the goal state provided to us.

8 B 4 </br>
7 6 5

Moreover, for Best First Search and A* algorithms, I have to implement them using 3 different admissible heuristics ( Hamming Distance, Manhattan Distance, and Permutation Inversion ) and 1 Inadmissible heuristic ( of my own choice ).
